## 🧑‍🔬 Mini Project

**Title**: *GIS-Based Analysis of Soil Health: A Comparative Study of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu*  

### 📌 Overview:  
This project explores the spatial distribution of soil health indicators across Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu using GIS tools and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. The study aims to:
- Analyze variations in soil health parameters like pH, organic carbon, and nitrogen levels.  
- Visualize spatial patterns using QGIS.  
- Generate insights for sustainable agricultural practices.  

### 🛠️ Tools and Techniques:
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** for storing and querying spatial data.  
- **QGIS** for mapping and visualization.  
- **Spatial Queries** to analyze soil health data.  

### 📋 Key Features:
- Comparative spatial analysis of the two regions.  
- GIS-based mapping of soil health parameters.  
- Insights for sustainable agricultural practices.
